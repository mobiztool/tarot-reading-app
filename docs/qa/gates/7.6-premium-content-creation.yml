    title: 'Content quality insufficient for premium price'
    impact: 'Low perceived value, subscription churn, negative reviews'
    probability: 'High - subjective quality, large content volume (27 positions)'
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - 'Tarot expert creates/reviews all 27 position interpretations'
      - 'Thai native speaker reviews language quality (not machine translated)'
      - 'User testing validates premium value (target >4.5/5 satisfaction)'
      - 'Content depth 100-200 words per position (2x free content)'
    monitor:
      - 'Content completion timeline (target 5-7 days)'
      - 'User feedback on interpretation quality'
      - 'Subscription churn rate (should decrease with quality content)'risk_profile: "docs/qa/assessments/7.6-risk-20260113.md"
