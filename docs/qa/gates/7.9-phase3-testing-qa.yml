    title: 'Testing incomplete before production launch'
    impact: 'Major bugs in production, user dissatisfaction, revenue loss, reputation damage'
    probability: 'High - timeline pressure causes test shortcuts'
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - 'Execute ALL test scenarios from Stories 7.1-7.8 (no shortcuts)'
      - 'Do NOT skip tests due to timeline pressure'
      - 'Fix all P0/P1 bugs before launch (zero tolerance)'
      - 'Obtain formal QA sign-off document'
      - 'Complete device/browser testing matrix'
      - 'Content expert review all 27 positions'
    monitor:
      - 'Test execution progress (daily standup)'
      - 'Bug triage and resolution rate'
      - 'Coverage metrics (must meet targets)'

# CRITICAL NOTE
testing_mandate: |
  This story CANNOT be compromised. Epic 7 success depends on thorough testing.
  Timeline pressure is NOT a valid reason to skip tests.
  QA has veto authority on launch if testing incomplete.
