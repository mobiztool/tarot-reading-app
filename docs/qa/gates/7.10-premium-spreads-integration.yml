# Risk Assessment (Added 2026-01-13)
risk_summary:
  totals:
    critical: 1  # OPS-001 (deployment fails)
    high: 2      # TECH-001 (integration breaks), OPS-002 (rollback untested)

    low: 1

    title: 'Production deployment fails or causes outage'
    impact: 'App down, revenue loss, user frustration, reputation damage'
    probability: 'High - complex deployment with many moving parts'
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - 'Test deployment process in staging environment first'
      - 'Smoke test suite automated and ready (15-20 min execution)'
      - 'Rollback procedure tested and documented (execute in <5 min)'
      - 'Team on standby for 24 hours post-launch'
      - 'Cross-epic integration testing (Epics 1-6 + 7)'
    monitor:
      - 'Error rate (alert if >1% for >5 min)'
      - 'Performance metrics (page load, API response)'
      - 'Premium spread usage analytics (track adoption)'
      - 'Payment success rate (ensure no regression)'
