    title: 'Layout component bugs affect all premium spreads'
    impact: 'Single component failure blocks Stories 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4'
    probability: 'High - complex shared component with multiple use cases'
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - 'Complete Story 7.5 BEFORE starting Stories 7.1-7.4 (blocking dependency)'
      - 'Integration tests with all 4 spread types (TC-7.5-120-151)'
      - 'Unit test coverage >95% for layout component'
      - 'Responsive testing at all breakpoints (desktop, tablet, mobile)'
    monitor:
      - 'Component reusability across spreads'
      - 'Performance with different card counts (5, 7, 10)'
      - 'Animation performance on various devices'
