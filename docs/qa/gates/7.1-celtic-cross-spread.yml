    title: 'Unauthorized premium access bypass'
    impact: 'Revenue loss - users access paid content without subscription'
    probability: 'High - complex access control with multiple edge cases'
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - 'Implement server-side tier validation in middleware and API'
      - 'Add comprehensive access control tests (TC-7.1-001 to TC-7.1-007)'
      - 'Device/browser testing matrix (10+ combinations)'
      - 'Performance testing with 10 cards (load time <2s, animation 60fps)'
    monitor:
      - 'Unauthorized access attempts (alert on >5/hour)'
      - 'Page load times (alert if >2s p95)'
      - 'Celtic Cross completion rate'
