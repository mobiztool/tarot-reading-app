## QA Results

### Review Date: 2026-01-16 | Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

**Gate: CONCERNS** → `docs/qa/gates/7.6-premium-content-creation.yml`

**Summary:** 27 premium position interpretations created with AI. Good structure and helper functions. **However, Tasks 3 and 5 INCOMPLETE** - Expert review and QA approval pending. Content quality cannot be verified without expert sign-off.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ 27 positions created (Celtic Cross, Decision Making, Self Discovery, Relationship)
- ✅ Thai and English versions
- ✅ Structured format (focus areas, interpretation guides, example questions)
- ✅ 80 tests passing (structure validation)
- ✅ Content loaded to database

**CRITICAL Concerns:**
- ❌ **Task 3 INCOMPLETE:** Tarot expert review NOT done
- ❌ **Task 5 INCOMPLETE:** PM + QA sign-off NOT obtained
- ⚠️ Content quality cannot be verified without expert review
- ⚠️ Thai language quality unknown (needs native speaker review)
- ⚠️ Tarot accuracy unknown (needs expert validation)

**Blocking Issues:**
- [ ] Tarot expert must review all 27 positions
- [ ] Thai proofreader must review language quality
- [ ] PM/QA approval required before launch

**Quality Score: 65/100** (Implementation good, but quality validation missing)

**Risk Profile:** `docs/qa/assessments/7.6-risk-20260113.md`

**Recommended Status:** ❌ **BLOCKED - Cannot approve without expert review**

**Action Required:** Complete Tasks 3 and 5 before Story can be marked "Done"
