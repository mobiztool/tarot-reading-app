# Story 2.8: Onboarding Flow for New Sign-ups

## Status

**Approved**

---

## Story

**As a** new user who just signed up,  
**I want** a brief welcome experience,  
**so that** I understand what benefits I get from having an account.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Post-signup welcome screen or modal shows after first login
2. Welcome message: "Welcome to [App Name]! Your readings are now saved automatically."
3. Benefit highlights: "Access your readings anytime", "Track your journey", "Unlock premium features soon"
4. Optional profile completion: "Add your name and profile picture" (skippable)
5. CTA button: "Start my first reading" navigates to reading selection
6. Onboarding shown only once: flag stored in user profile or localStorage
7. Skip option: "Skip for now" closes onboarding, can access later from profile
8. Mobile friendly: onboarding works well on mobile screens
9. Analytics tracked: `onboarding_completed`, `onboarding_skipped`
