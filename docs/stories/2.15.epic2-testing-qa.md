# Story 2.15: Epic 2 Testing & Quality Assurance

## Status

**Approved**

---

## Story

**As a** QA tester,  
**I want** comprehensive testing of all authentication and history features,  
**so that** we ship a stable, secure feature set that users can trust.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Functional testing: all user stories tested manually on mobile and desktop
2. E2E tests: critical flows automated with Playwright:
   - Full signup flow (email + password)
   - Login and logout flow
   - Password reset flow
   - View reading history
   - Delete reading
3. Security testing: attempt unauthorized access, test RLS policies, verify token security
4. Cross-browser testing: Safari iOS, Chrome Android, Desktop browsers
5. Accessibility testing: forms usable with keyboard, screen reader compatible
6. Performance testing: auth operations complete in <1s, history loads quickly
7. Edge cases tested: weak passwords, duplicate emails, expired tokens, network failures
8. Integration testing: Supabase Auth integration verified in staging environment
9. Email deliverability: test emails received and formatted correctly
10. Regression testing: Epic 1 features still work correctly with Epic 2 changes
11. All P0 and P1 bugs fixed before shipping
12. Known issues documented and prioritized for future fixes
